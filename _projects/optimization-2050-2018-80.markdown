#### Overview
This document includes assumptions, results and interactive figures about the optimization for the Spanish energy mix in **2050** considering **2018** data with a **80%** of emission reduction.
<br>
<br>
#### Main assumptions for 2050 electric mix
- Shut down of **coal** power plants.
- Shut down of **nuclear** power plants.
- Cogeneration power reduced from 5.74 GW (2018) to **1.44 GW** (2040), a 75% reduction.
- Fuel & gas power reduced form 2.49 GW (2018) to **0.62 GW** (2040), a 75% reduction.
- New solar thermal power plants have **15-hour** thermal storage capacity with a **90%** of storage efficiency.
- Pumping turbidity power increased from 3.3 GW (2018) to **10 GW** (2050).
- Pumping turbidity capacity increased from 14 GWh (2018) to **42.4 GWh** (2040) with a **76%** of storage efficiency.
- Some coal power plants are adapted** to **store dumped electricity** from photovoltaic and wind energy in molten salt tanks with a maximum capacity of **11.3 GWh** with a storage efficiency of **39%** and a nominal power of **2.3 GW**.
- **0.5%** annual demand increment from 2018 to 2030 and **1.5%** from 2030 to 2050.
- **80%** emission reduction with respect to 1990.
