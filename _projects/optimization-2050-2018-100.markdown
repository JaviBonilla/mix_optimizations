#### Overview
This document includes assumptions, results and interactive figures about the optimization for the Spanish energy mix in **2050** considering **2018** data with a **100%** of emission reduction.
<br>
<br>
#### Main assumptions for 2050 electric mix
- Shut down of **coal** power plants.
- Shut down of **nuclear** power plants.
- Shut down of **cogeneration** power plants.
- Shut down of **fuel & gas** power plants.
- Shut down of **residues** power plants.
- Shut down of **combined cycle** power plants.
- New solar thermal power plants have **12-hour** thermal storage capacity with a **90%** of storage efficiency.
- Pumped hydropower increased from 3.3 GW (2018) to **10 GW** (2050).
- Pumped hydropower capacity increased from 14 GWh (2018) to **42.4 GWh** (2040) with a **76%** of storage efficiency.
- Electric batteries with **10 GW** of power and **40 GW** of capacity.
- **0.5%** annual demand increment from 2018 to 2030 and **1.5%** from 2030 to 2050.
- **100%** emission reduction with respect to 1990.
