#### Overview
This document includes assumptions, results and interactive figures about the optimization for the Spanish energy mix in **2030** considering **2018** data with a **60%** of emission reduction.
<br>
<br>
#### Main assumptions for 2030 electric mix
- Shut down of **coal** power plants.
- Nuclear power reduced from 7.1 GW (2018) to **3.2 GW** (2030).
- Cogeneration power reduced from 5.74 GW (2018) to **2.87 GW** (2030), a **50%** reduction.
- Fuel & gas power reduced form 2.49 GW (2018) to **1.25 GW** (2030), a **50%**% reduction.
- New solar thermal power plants have **12-hour** thermal storage capacity with a **90%** of storage efficiency.
- Pumped hydropower increased from 3.3 GW (2018) to **6.8 GW** (2030).
- Pumped hydropower capacity increased from 14 GWh (2018) to **28.8 GWh** (2030) with a **76%** of storage efficiency.
- Electric batteries with **2.5 GW** of power and **10 GW** of capacity.
- **0.5%** annual demand increment (from 2018).
- **60%** emission reduction with respect to 1990.
